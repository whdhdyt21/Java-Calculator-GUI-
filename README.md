# Java Calculator with GUI and MVC Model

## Overview
Java Calculator is a simple yet effective calculator application built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for a clean separation of concerns.

## Features
1. **User-Friendly GUI**: The application offers an intuitive graphical interface for easy interaction.
2. **MVC Architecture**: Ensures a well-structured codebase with clear separation between the data (Model), the user interface (View), and the control logic (Controller).
   - **Model (CalculatorModel.java)**: Manages the data and business logic.
   - **View (CalculatorView.java)**: Handles the display and user interactions.
   - **Controller (CalculatorController.java)**: Manages the flow of data and updates the view based on user inputs.
